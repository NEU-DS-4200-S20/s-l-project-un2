      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p>
        For our project, we chose to create a learning map that educates users
        on 2019 UNFPA initiatives in each member country. We chose to focus on
        an interactive map visualization that allowed a user to explore
        initiatives by filtering the map by category and/or country. For our
        data, we needed a way to efectively show our mostly qualitative data in
        an interesting and engaging way. We also wanted to present a map that
        provided an overview of the progress made on UNFPA goals, while
        encouraging the user to explore details on different countries'
        initiatives. We aimed to reach this goal of exploration and learning in
        a format that was easy to understand and would be compelling to a wide
        range of users.

      <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

      <p>
        The visualization is an interactive world map that has a linked modal
        table that provides the details of the data. The visualization presents
        two facets to the data: Category (of the types of initiative) and
        Country. Both of these can be selected directly with the dropdown
        filters, but there is also interaction in the visualization. By clicking
        on a country on the map, that country is zoomed in and outlined to
        provide feedback about the selection. The two halves of the
        visualization are linked, so changes in one are reflected in the other.
        We choose to use a map as our external partners requested it, and we
        used a table because the data is largely qualitative and resists
        quantitization. The map also serves as a heatmap of total counts of
        inititives for the selected category. Once the user has selected a point
        in the 2-dimensional Category-Country plane, they are free to move along
        either the Country or Category line to explore the data, which is a set
        of initiatives with some qualities. The tasks we chose to support were
        what we identified as the most important from our task analysis.
      </p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        The data used in our visualization was collected from the various
        country offices of UNFPA and records advancements the offices have made
        in regards to the specific UNFPA strategic plan (SP) goals.The data has
        been put together in its current form by UNFPAâ€™s data specialist, who
        determined which advancement falls into which SP goal best. The data is
        exclusively categorical and mostly non-numerical. To convert our data
        into a workable format we focused on the variables that involved the
        UNFPA member countries, initiative categories, or "Thematic Area
        Categories", and created a new variable that provided a count of the
        initiatives that fit under each category.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p>
        Our first and most crucial domain task was for the user to be able to
        view UNFPA initiatives by category. This task has the low-level task of
        identifying and comparing, the mid-level task of locating, and the high
        level task of consuming, or discovering. We do this by allowing our user
        to filter the map by choosing a category from the dropdown, giving them
        the option to select a country of interest on the map, and provding
        details to the intiatives for the country they have selected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to our first domain task, our second is to view initiatives by
        country. This task has the same low level and high level task as our
        first domain task, but has the mid-level task of browsing. The
        visualization achieves this by letting the user choose a country from
        the dropdown and see an overview of all of the UNFPA initiatives they
        have implemented in 2019.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our third domain task is for our user to see the details of each
        country's initiatives, which allows the user to identify, locate, and
        consume our visulization, or see presented data. After the user chooses
        and selects a country of interest, the table that appears presents
        details for the reader to learn more about a certain country's
        initiatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our final domain task is to provide further information on a specific UN
        initiative, which allows a user to identify, browse, and consume
        presented data in the visualization. After the reader has looked at the
        table with details on a country's initiatives, they will be provided
        with links to the UNFPA website to learn more about the organization's
        related resources on a particular intiative or initiative category.
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <h2>Early Sketching</h2>
      <p>
        Given our domain task analysis, we each hand sketched a few directions
        our visualization could go in. Below are some our early sketches that
        inspired our final design.
      </p>

      <img src="images/early-sketch-1.jpg" alt="Early sketch 1" />
      <img src="images/early-sketch-2.jpg" alt="Early sketch 1" />
      <img src="images/early-sketch-3.jpg" alt="Early sketch 1" />

      <p>
        Since our data has a substantial amount of qualitative information about
        multiple countries, we thought a map would be the best visualization for
        users to see an overview of how the UNFPAâ€™s global offices are
        progressing on different family planning initiatives. These sketches
        also take advantage of filtering and multiple linked views in order to
        achieve our domain tasks.
      </p>

      <h2>Digital Sketching</h2>
      <p>
        Next, we synthesized our ideas from our hand sketches to a polished
        digital sketch. Below are some screenshots of the digital sketch we
        designed.
      </p>

      <img src="images/digital-sketch-1.png" alt="Digital sketch 1" />
      <img src="images/digital-sketch-2.png" alt="Digital sketch 1" />
      <img src="images/digital-sketch-3.png" alt="Digital sketch 1" />

      <p>
        The two major tasks we expected our users to have were the ability to
        view UNFPA initiatives by category and the ability to view those same
        initiatives by country. The way our design achieves this is with a
        two-panel layout, where the left-hand side has a map and the right-hand
        side is a table that displays our categorical data. We included two
        dropdowns to filter the data represented in the table and map.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, we were prepared to begin implementation and broke up our
        visualization into a clear task to-do list.
      </p>

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>

      <p>
        After our first sprint, we shared our visualization with our peers for
        usability testing. We tested our completed features such as the category
        dropdown and our heat map/choropleth map. For the most part, our users
        found our visualization fairly easy to navigate. However, we also became
        aware of some areas of confusion with our users, such as the language
        and terms we were using along with our lack of a country selection
        indicator. Given this feedback, we tweaked our word choice, removed any
        unclear acronyms, and added a clear outline to selected countries.
      </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>
        Our project was a collaboration effort between an outside organization,
        UNFPA, and our class. Thus, we had regular communication with UNFPA's
        data team on what sort of visualization would be the most useful to
        them. This helped shape our project, but also set the expectations high.
        We used appropriate libraires that were allowed by the rubric for this
        class, but much of our end result was coded in basic Javascript. We were
        able to change the format to align with our drafts, creating a two-panel
        view with an interactive map and table with drop-down as well as
        click-prompted filters. Due to the time constraints, we were not able to
        make the end product as seamless and elegant as we would have liked, but
        we were able to present a simple yet effective visualization that UNFPA
        can use for its own purpose. For the future, additional search and
        filter options could be built in, as well as links that would lead the
        user to external sites.

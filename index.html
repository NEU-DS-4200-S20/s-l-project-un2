      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >For our project, we chose to create a learning map that educates
          users on 2019 UNFPA initiatives in each member country. We chose to
          focus on an interactive map visualization that allowed a user to
          explore initiatives by filtering the map by category and/or country.
          For our data, we needed a way to efectively show our mostly
          qualitative data in an interesting and engaging way. We also wanted to
          present a map that provided an overview of the progress made on UNFPA
          goals, while encouraging the user to explore details on different
          countries' initiatives. We aimed to reach this goal of exploration and
          learning in a format that was easy to understand and would be
          compelling to a wide range of users.</em

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications,
          UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em
        >
      </p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p>
        <em
          >The data used in our visualization was collected from the various
          country offices of UNFPA and records advancements the offices have
          made in regards to the specific UNFPA strategic plan (SP) goals.The
          data has been put together in its current form by UNFPA’s data
          specialist, who determined which advancement falls into which SP goal
          best. The data is exclusively categorical and mostly non-numerical. To
          convert our data into a workable format we focused on the variables
          that involved the UNFPA member countries, initiative categories, or
          "Thematic Area Categories", and created a new variable that provided a
          count of the initiatives that fit under each category.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >Our first and most crucial domain task was for the user to be able to
          view UNFPA initiatives by category. This task has the low-level task
          of identifying and comparing, the mid-level task of locating, and the
          high level task of consuming, or discovering. We do this by allowing
          our user to filter the map by choosing a category from the dropdown,
          giving them the option to select a country of interest on the map, and
          provding details to the intiatives for the country they have
          selected.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Similar to our first domain task, our second is to view initiatives
          by country. This task has the same low level and high level task as
          our first domain task, but has the mid-level task of browsing. The
          visualization achieves this by letting the user choose a country from
          the dropdown and see an overview of all of the UNFPA initiatives they
          have implemented in 2019.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Our third domain task is for our user to see the details of each
          country's initiatives, which allows the user to identify, locate, and
          consume our visulization, or see presented data. After the user
          chooses and selects a country of interest, the table that appears
          presents details for the reader to learn more about a certain
          country's initiatives.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Our final domain task is to provide further information on a specific
          UN initiative, which allows a user to identify, browse, and consume
          presented data in the visualization. After the reader has looked at
          the table with details on a country's initiatives, they will be
          provided with links to the UNFPA website to learn more about the
          organization's related resources on a particular intiative or
          initiative category.</em
        >
      </p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p>
        <em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement. Logical discussion of
          design choices grounded in theory from course. Discusses feedback from
          usability testing.</em
        >
      </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p>
        <em
          >Our project was a collaboration effort between an outside organization, UNFPA, and our class. 
          Thus, we had regular communication with UNFPA's data team on what sort of visualization would be the most 
          useful to them. This helped shape our project, but also set the expectations high.
          We used appropriate libraires that were allowed by the rubric for this class, but much of our end result was
          coded in basic Javascript. We were able to change the format to align with our drafts, creating a two-panel view with
          an interactive map and table with drop-down as well as click-prompted filters.
          Due to the time constraints, we were not able to make the end product as seamless and elegant as we would have liked, but
          we were able to present a simple yet effective visualization that UNFPA can use for its own purpose. For the future,
          additional search and filter options could be built in, as well as links that would lead the user to external sites. (Note: conclusion
          will be further fleshed out when final product is finished) </em
